# SnapEngine Project Structure

This document describes the top-level directory structure of the SnapEngine project for AI agents and developers.

## Directory Structure

```
SnapEngineJS/
├── src/              # Core library source code
├── doc/              # Documentation
├── demo/             # Demo applications (Svelte, React, Vanilla)
├── tests/            # Test suites (unit and e2e)
├── dist/             # Build output (generated)
├── node_modules/     # Dependencies (generated)
└── [config files]    # Build and tooling configuration
```

## Key Directories

### `src/`
**Core library source code.**

Contains the engine implementation: render pipeline, object system, camera, input handling, collision detection, and animation.

See `src/AGENTS.md` for detailed module descriptions.

### `doc/`
**Documentation.**

- `overview.md` - High-level engine concepts and API documentation

### `demo/`
**Demo applications showcasing engine features.**

```
demo/
├── svelte/           # Svelte demo app (dev testbed)
├── react/            # React demo app (dev testbed)
├── vanilla/          # Vanilla JS demo (dev testbed)
├── snap-engine-demo/ # SvelteKit-based promotional website
└── app.scss          # Shared demo styles
```

The `svelte/`, `react/`, and `vanilla/` demos serve as development testbeds for testing engine features during development. These may be used for e2e testing in the future.

The `snap-engine-demo/` is a separate SvelteKit site intended as a promotional website to showcase the engine to potential users.


### `tests/`
**Test suites.**

```
tests/
├── e2e/              # End-to-end tests (Playwright)
└── ut/               # Unit tests
```

Run with `npx playwright test` (e2e) or the configured test runner.

### `dist/`
**Build output.** Generated by Vite. Contains the bundled library for distribution.
