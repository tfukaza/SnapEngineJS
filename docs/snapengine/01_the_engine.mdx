Whenever you make anything with SnapEngine, you must first create an `Engine` instance. 
Each `Engine` manages its own camera, objects, and features (collision detection, debug overlay, etc.). 
You can spawn multiple `Engine` instances on a single page, and for the most part they operate in isolation from each other.
<br/>

An engine will always need a container element assigned to it. This element will be the area where the engine will perform 
most of its functionalities, such as input handling and rendering. 

```typescript
import { Engine } from "snapengine";
const container = document.getElementById("engine-container");
const engine = new Engine();
engine.element = container;
```

You may have noticed the `element` property is set after instantiating the `Engine`. 
This is because SnapEngine is designed to be integrated into frontend frameworks like React or Svelte,
many of which are designed to generate the DOM elements after the component logic runs. 

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
   import { Engine } from "snapengine";
   let engine: Engine;
   engine = new Engine();
</script>
<div bind:this={engine.element} class="engine-container"></div>
```
```tsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import { Engine } from "snapengine";

export function EngineComponent() {
   const containerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
   const engine = useRef<Engine | null>(null);
   useEffect(() => {
      engine.current = new Engine();
      if (containerRef.current) {
         engine.current.element = containerRef.current;
      }
   }, []);
   return <div ref={containerRef} className="engine-container"></div>;
}
```

In addition, all `Engine` instances share a single global object called the `GlobalManager`. 
This singleton is responsible for orchestrating the render loop, managing global input events, and holding the shared render queues. 
The `GlobalManager` is automatically created when the first `Engine` is instantiated, so you don't need to worry about it.
